Variables
variables are containers for storing data values
Data types
str      - name = "satheesh"
int      - course_fee = 800
float    - course_rating = 4.9
bool     - starting_soon  = True
NoneType - total_income = None

Whatever inside double quotes " " - treated as String
course_rating = "4.9" - here type will be 'str'

To check type of data
print(type(name))

To increase fee by 10%
print(course_fee+(course_fee*0.1))

String Concat and formatting
first_name = "parnapalli"
last_name = "satheesh"
to concat first name & last name - print(first_name+last_name)
to concat first name & last name with a space - print(first_name+ " " +last_name)

print("my first name is " +first_name +" and my last name is " +last_name)
print(f"my first name is {first_name} and my last name is {last_name}")
my first name is parnapalli and my last name is satheesh

To give an input
To calculate Total salary after hike
salary = input("how much: "))
hike = input("percentage: "))
total_salary = int(salary) + (int(salary) * int(hike) /100)
print(total_salary)
