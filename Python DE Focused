Variables
variables are containers for storing data values
Data types
str      - name = "satheesh"
int      - course_fee = 800
float    - course_rating = 4.9
bool     - starting_soon  = True
NoneType - total_income = None

Whatever inside double quotes " " - treated as String
course_rating = "4.9" - here type will be 'str'

To check type of data
print(type(name))

To increase fee by 10%
print(course_fee+(course_fee*0.1))

String Concat and formatting
first_name = "parnapalli"
last_name = "satheesh"
to concat first name & last name - print(first_name+last_name)
to concat first name & last name with a space - print(first_name+ " " +last_name)

print("my first name is " +first_name +" and my last name is " +last_name)
print(f"my first name is {first_name} and my last name is {last_name}")
my first name is parnapalli and my last name is satheesh

To give an input
To calculate Total salary after hike
salary = input("how much: "))
hike = input("percentage: "))
total_salary = int(salary) + (int(salary) * int(hike) /100)
print(total_salary)

Arithmetic functions
*
/ - print(5/2) =2.5
+
-
% Modulus - is gets remainder value
** Exponential  - print(5**3) = 125
// Floor division - rounds the result down to the nearest whole number - print(5//2) = 2
print(2**2**3) = 256
for exponential alone it will bind from right to left. so first 2**3 = 8 then 2**8=256

import math
sales = 500.10
print(math.ceil(sales)) = 501 - round to upper value
print(math.floor(sales)) = 500 - round to lower value
sales = -500.10
print(math.fabs(sales)) = 501 - 500.1 - just it will convert -/+ values to opposite

Conditional statements
If Else

marks=int(input("enter marks: "))
if marks>50:
    print("pass")
else:
   print( "fail")

Nested if else statement

marks=int(input("enter marks:"))
if marks>50:
    if marks>80:
        print("A grade")
    else:
        print("passed but didn't secured A grade")
else:
   print( "fail")

marks=int(input("enter marks:"))

Better & neat version
if marks>80:
        print("A grade")
elif marks>=40:
        print("passed but didn't secured A grade")
else:
   print( "fail")

Logical operators
AND
OR
NOT

age=int(input("age:"))
crime_record = input("any records yes/no:")
if age>=18 and crime_record == "yes":
    print("normal prison")
else:
    print("juvenile prison")

String - A sequence of characters
we can enclose in " " or ' ' or """ """
String is immutable & we cannot alter it.

print('parnapalli' satheesh')
it will give error, but using back slash or escape character \.
print('parnapalli\' satheesh')
o/p - parnapalli'satheesh

/n is used to print content in a new line
print("parnapalli\nsatheesh")
o/p - 
parnapalli
satheesh

\t is a tab

For multi line we use """ """
print("""parnapalli
        satheesh""")
o/p 
parnapalli
        satheesh

String related operations
To conact two strings
f_name = input("enter f_name:")
l_name = input("enter l_name:")
print(f_name +" "+ l_name)
o/p = Parnapalli Satheesh

To print lenth of string
f_name =("parnapalli")
print(len(f_name))
o/p = 10

indexing - helps to get a particular character
slicing - helps to get to a piece of characters

f_name =("parnapalli")
print(f_name[4])
o/p = a
index start from 0.

To get last character of a string
f_name =("parnapalli")
print(f_name[-1])
o/p = i

name =("parnapalli satheesh")
print(name[0:10])
o/p = parnapalli
here 10th character is excluded.

To print till the end
name =("parnapalli satheesh")
print(name[11:])
or
name =("parnapalli satheesh")
print(name[11:19])
or 
name =("parnapalli satheesh")
print(name[11:len(name)])
o/p = satheesh
here 19th character is excluded.

to print last characters
name =("parnapalli satheesh")
print(name[-8:])
o/p = satheesh

to print everything after space
name =("parnapalli satheesh")
index = name.find(" ")
print(name[index+1:])
o/p = satheesh
index is space, index+1 will print next character after space.
